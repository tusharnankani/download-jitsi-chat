# Download Jitsi Chat

Download and save your Jitsi Meet Chats within seconds ⚡

## Introduction

-   [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet) multiplatform voice, video conferencing and instant messaging applications for various platforms.
-   Jitsi does have a feature (for self-hosted instance) to download the chat - [Forum - How to save chats?](https://community.jitsi.org/t/how-to-how-to-save-chats-and-speaker-stats/80904) - but it is using plugins and is quite complex.
-   So, I wrote a [script](src/script.js) to download the chat.

### Motivation

Why?

-   [Our Tech Community (OTC)](https://twitter.com/OurTechComm) is an open for all tech community, and we have weekly meetups on Jitsi Meet.
-   Project Links, GitHub Links, Twitter Handles are shared in every meet, in the chat.
-   To save those links, for further references, this script was created.

## Usage

-   Go to [src/script.js](src/script.js) and click on `raw`.
-   Copy the script as it is and paste it in the console of the Jitsi Meet.
-   Your script will be downloaded and saved in `Meet_Name.txt` format.

## Future Scope?

-   A web extension.
-   Even better, creating a PR - implementing this in [Jitsi](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet).
